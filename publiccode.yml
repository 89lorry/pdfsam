      ### PDF merge


      Merge is the most used PDFsam Basic module and lets you combine PDF files
      together


      ##### Page ranges


      Input PDF files can be merged completely or  partially. A page selection
      can be set in the form of comma separated  page intervals (Ex. 1-10, 14,
      25-) letting you specify what pages you  want to merge for every input PDF
      file                        


      ##### Bookmarks


      Set what to do with the bookmarks of the  merged PDF files. You can merge
      them together, discard them to keep the  resulting file smaller or create
      a new bookmarks tree with one entry for  every merged PDF
      file                        


      ##### AcroForms


      Set what to do with AcroForms when they are  found in the input PDF file.
      You can discard them but also merge them  into a new form or even merge
      them renaming fields with name clashes                         


      ##### Table of contents


      Add a table of contents at the beginning of  the generated PDF. A list of
      clickable entries will let you easily  navigate through the merged PDF
      files


      ### PDF split


      ##### Split at predefined pages


      The selected PDF file can be split after  every page, generating a new
      document for every page in the original  file, or after every even or odd
      page                        


      ##### Split specifying pages


      Specify the page numbers where you want to  break your document. You can
      even tell PDFsam to split the PDF every _n_ pages                        


      ### PDF Split by size


      Divide PDF files into smaller ones of a given size (roughly)


      ### PDF Split by bookmarks


      Select the outline (bookmarks) level you  want to split at and your
      PDFfile will be divided at every page pointed  by the bookmarks at the
      selected level


      ### PDF mix


      The PDF mix module lets you  merge two or more PDF files taking pages
      alternately from each input  file, in straight or reverse order. The
      perfect match for your  single-sided scans


      ### Rotate PDF


      The PDF Rotate module lets  you rotate PDF files by simply selecting the
      files you want to rotate  and apply a rotation of 90, 180 or 270 degrees
      to all or some of their  pages


      ### Extract pages


      The Extract module lets you  extract pages from PDF files. Single pages or
      page ranges can be  selected to create a new PDF file containing only the
      pages you need
